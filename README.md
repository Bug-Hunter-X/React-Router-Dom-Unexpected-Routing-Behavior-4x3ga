This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in React Router Dom v6.  The issue involves unexpected routing behavior, where routes may fail to render correctly or the app gets stuck in a seemingly endless loading state. This often happens after specific user interactions or component updates.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code. The solution, in `bugSolution.js`, addresses the issue using a more robust approach to route handling and navigation.  The key to understanding and solving this issue often lies in carefully examining how components interact with the routing system and ensuring the navigation process happens correctly and predictably.
